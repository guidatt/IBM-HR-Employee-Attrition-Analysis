## ðŸ“Œ About the project
The primary objective of this study is to comprehend employee attrition at IBM, one of the world's largest and most significant companies. The main idea here is to understand how each variable in the dataset can influence attrition. Through this analysis, I aim to generate insights and explore possible solutions.

## ðŸ’¼ Analysis and KPI

In general, multiple factors can influence the departure of employees:

- Dissatisfaction with the pay;
- Lack of career development;
- Dissatisfaction with the work environment, people, work-life balance, or with their role;
- Relocating to another sector or leaving for another company;
- Retirement;

In this study, we will analyze deeply the different factors that influenced the departures at IBM.

**KPI:**
- Attrition Rate: Number of Departures / Total Number of Employees x 100

## ðŸ“Š Insights

- Younger individuals are more likely to leave the company, possibly due to their willingness to take risks and seek new experiences.
- Employees from the Human Resources department who left the company had the lowest income compared to other departments. Additionally, it was observed that 33.3% were dissatisfied with the work environment, and 41.7% expressed dissatisfaction with their job.
- There is a significant likelihood that the increased attrition rate in this department is correlated with income and dissatisfaction with the work environment and the job itself.
- The Attrition Percent is notably higher for individuals with "Bad" or "Low" Environment Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance values.

## ðŸš§ Recommendations

- As we've seen, younger individuals are more likely to leave the company, possibly due to their willingness to take risks and seek new experiences. A solution would be for IBM to propose an appealing career plan for these individuals, emphasizing internal growth opportunities and potential new experiences within the company.
- Regarding issues in the human resources department, offering higher salaries for these professionals (considering that they receive significantly less in comparison to other departments) and increased internal investment can contribute to retaining more professionals in the company.
- Overall, conducting internal research with employees is imperative to gain a detailed understanding of the specific reasons for dissatisfaction and to proactively prevent employee turnover.
